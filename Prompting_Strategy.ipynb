Some reviews describe the vacuum as \"AMAZING\" and a \"game-changer,\" highlighting the convenience of its cordless design. However, significant complaints arise regarding battery life, with several users experiencing rapid depletion (as low as 10-15 minutes) that makes it difficult to complete cleaning tasks, especially in larger homes. Additional issues include dissatisfaction with the vacuum's weight, noise level, and build quality, leading to frustration from some customers who consider it a waste of money. Overall, while many users highly recommend the product, others have found it disappointing and problematic, resulting in a mixed overall sentiment regarding its value.\n",
